<h4 id="Why"><a href="#Why" class="headerlink" title="Why?"></a>Why?</h4><p>First of all, many people have asked about donation, so here it is!</p>
<p>Second, in all good conscience, the most of the visible costs are covered by us, like the domain name. We also spend a tremendous time to make Hexo running and functioning. This is the real cost and also invisible. </p>
<h4 id="Benefits"><a href="#Benefits" class="headerlink" title="Benefits?!"></a>Benefits?!</h4><p>We thank for every penny donations, here is a list of benefits you and us can achieve:</p>
<ol>
<li>Covers our cost.</li>
<li>Motivate and admit our work.</li>
<li>List your name on Hexo.io website (2.5k users and 10k pageviews per day)!</li>
</ol>
<p>There are two tiers of donation: </p>
<ul>
<li>Less than $100, your name and website link will be on the donator list.</li>
<li>More than $100, your name, icon, and website link will be on the home page for at least one month (depend on the amount).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> Again, thanks for your support! </strong></p>
